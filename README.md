## Usage

After opening the app for the first time you will not have any cards lists, to create one press the **+** symbol in the bottom right corner, enter your deck name and click **Confirm**.

To enter a deck double click an element (they contain name and current card count), to delete a deck perform a long press on a deck panel and confirm that you indeed want to delete the deck (if not just click away from the confirmation panel).

After entering a deck you will be presented with two new options in the upper menu:

- **Back** - returns to deck view
- **Clear acquired** - removes cards in the current deck annotated with green star

To add cards to your deck press the **+** symbol to enter card adding menu, enter name of a card and press **Search**. Select cards that you want by clicking the star and making it turn green and then click **Confirm**. Empty element in the adding menu is there on purpose to act as a separator. If you continue to click the search button you will get different pages with other card versions. Press **Clear** to remove all search results.
